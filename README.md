# HR-Employee-Attrition

In this project we use Microsoft SQL on HR employee attrition datasets to retrieve relevant data, filter and aggregate information, 
perform trend analysis, join related tables, and ultimately gain insights into the factors influencing attrition within the organization.

A Few Takeaways from this project:

There are 1470 employee's recorded.

30% of employees have 5+ years of experinece are between ages 27 an 35.

Human Resource department has employees with the highest maximum salary compared to all other departments. 
On the other hand, the Research and Development department has the lowest minimum salary compared to all other departments, 
and these employees have received less than a 13% salary hike. This information could potentially inform future compensation and HR strategies for these departments.
